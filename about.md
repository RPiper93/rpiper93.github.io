Rebecca Piper

Graduated from Durham University in 2015 with BSC (Honours) in Mathematical Sciences.

After graduating from University, I became interested in learning how to code. I spent a few months using online resources such as [codeschool](www.codeschool.com) and [codecademy](www.codecademy.com), but I felt that although I was learning syntax and solving problems, it would take me a long time to feel confident enough to actually create things of my own.

So, I looked for a more structured course, and Ronin was the best one I found. It seemed intense, but it included everything I wanted. Most importantly, it involved pair-programming. This meant I could do an online course from home, but still have contact with others working through the same course.

I applied for Ronin, and now I'm here. And so is this blog.

Anything else about me?

When I'm not busy with Ronin, I'm busy with rehearsals for an upcoming local production of 'Into the Woods', where I'm playing the Evil Stepsister. I'm also aiming to be able to run 5k by the time Ronin finishes, because I find running (and even walking) better than meditating, and it's nice to get outside and away from the computer for 20 minutes or so.
